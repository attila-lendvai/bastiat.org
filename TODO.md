Texts
-----

  * Import all texts that are missing from Bastiat.org

  * Do another pass of proofreading by comparing to the original edition,
    and/or by comparing independent digitizations.


Infrastructure
--------------

  * Fix exscribe, so it's obvious where the error is.

  * Use a relative URL for the CSS.

  * Strong should be small-caps, as in the original edition, rather
    than bold (to have bold, use a bold tag).

  * Repair links to Gallica.

  * Re-center a paragraphe in "le Vol Ã  la prime"

  * Fonts: use an old one in the style of the original edition for
    Bastiat writings, another one for other text.
