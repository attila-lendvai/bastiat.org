<p>
Frédéric Bastiat was born in Bayonne, France on June 29, 1801,
the son of a wholesale merchant.
However, Frédéric was orphaned at the age of nine and was brought up
by his grandfather and his aunt.
<p>
Bastiat lived in a revolutionary period.
He was fourteen when Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo
and exiled to St. Helena.
Frédéric Bastiat rose to prominence
with the publication of an article favoring free trade.
Bastiat was, beyond all other men, an economic pamphleteer,
the greatest exposer of economic fallacies,
the most powerful champion of free trade on the European Continent.
<p>
Bastiat's chief method of argument was the method of exaggeration.
He was the master of the <i>redutio ad absurdum</i>.
He used exaggeration to ridicule political ideas
that reduced economic efficiency.
If local farmers need to be protected against foreigners,
why not protect candle-makers from the superior competition of the sun?
Why not petition the Chamber of Deputies to outlaw windows
to increase the production of candles?
<p>
If politicians wanted to prevent free trade
by forcing trains to stop and transfer their cargo to increase jobs,
why not force all trains to reload every ten miles? every two miles?
The following essay demonstrates the use of Bastiat's wit
to illustrate the negative consequences
of protecting favored groups from direct competition.
<p>
Bastiat had more than scintillating wit and felicity of expressions.
His logic, too, was powerful.
Once he had grasped and explained a principle,
he could put the argument in so many forms as to leave no one
an excuse for missing or evading it.
<p>
Bastiat is accused of being something of a polemicist and he was.
It was unfortunate that for so long he stood alone,
while other "orthodox" economists refrained from criticizing socialism
or defending capitalism for fear of losing their reputations for
"scientific impartiality,"
and so left the field entirely to the socialist and communist agitators
who were less timorous in this respect. We could use more Bastiats today.

<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>Paul:</b>
<td>My dear colleagues, every day large quantities of wood enter Paris, and as
a result large sums of money leave the city. At this rate we shall all be
ruined in three years, and then what will become of the poor? <i>[Cheers.]</i>
Let us ban all foreign wood. It is not on my behalf that I am speaking,
because all the wood I own would not make one toothpick. Hence, I am
completely free from any personal interests in regard to this question.
<i>[Hear! Hear!]</i> But Peter here has a grove of trees and will guarantee to
supply fuel for our fellow citizens, who will no longer be dependent upon
charcoal sellers of the Yonne.<sup><a href="#endnot6">7</a></sup> Has it ever
occurred to you that we run the danger of dying of cold if the owners of the
foreign forests took it into their heads not to deliver wood to Paris any
longer? Therefore, let us ban their wood. By this means we shall prevent the
draining away of our money, create a domestic woodcutting industry and open to
our workers a new source of employment and income. <i>[Applause]</i>
<p>
<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>John:</b>
<td>I support this proposal by the distinguished previous speaker, who is so
humanitarian, and, as he himself said, so completely disinterested. It is high
time we put a stop to this brazen <i>laissez passer</i>, which has brought
unbridled competition into our market, so that there is not one province whose
situation is at all advantageous for the production of any commodity
whatsoever that does not flood us with it, undersell us, and destroy Parisian
industry. It is the duty of the government to equalize the conditions of
production by the imposition of judiciously selected duties, to admit only
goods that cost more outside Paris than they do within the city, and in this
way to extricate us from an unequal contest. How, for instance, can we be
expected to produce milk and butter in Paris in competition with Brittany and
Normandy? Just remember, gentlemen, that it costs the Bretons less for their
land, their fodder, and their labor. Is it not only common sense to equalize
opportunities by a protective town tariff: I demand that the duty on milk and
butter be raised to 1000%, and higher if need be. Breakfast may cost the
people a little more on that account, but how their wages will go up as well!
We shall see barns and dairies rising, creameries multiply, new industries
established. It is not that I stand to profit in the least from the adoption
of my proposal. I am not a cowherd, nor do I wish to be one. My only desire is
to be helpful to the toiling masses. <i>[Cheers and applause.]</i>
<p>
<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>Peter:</b>
<td>I am delighted to find that this assembly includes statesmen so pure in
heart, so enlightened, so dedicated to the best interests of the people.
<i>[Cheers.]</i> I admire their disinterestedness, and I can do no better than
imitate their noble example. I second their motion, and I add to it a motion
of my own to prohibit the entry of pigs from Poitou.<sup><a
href="#endnot6">8</a></sup> It is not that I have any desire to become a
swineherd or a pork butcher; in that case, my conscience would make it my duty
to remain silent. But is it not disgraceful, gentlemen, that we should be
forced to pay <i>tribute</i> to these Poitou peasants, who have the audacity
to come right into our own market and seize possession of an industry that we
ourselves could carry on; and who, after flooding us with their sausages and
hams, take perhaps nothing from us in return? In any case, who will tell us
that the balance of trade is not in their favor and that we are not obliged to
pay them the balance due in hard cash? Is it not clear that if this industry
were transplanted from Poitou to Paris, it would create jobs for Parisian
workingmen? And then, gentlemen, is it not quite possible, as M. Lestiboudois
so well observed, that we may be buying salt pork from Poitou, not with what
we sell them in return, but with our capital? How long can we go on doing
that? Let us not, then, allow a pack of greedy, grasping, false-hearted
competitors to come here and undersell us and make it impossible for us to
produce the same commodities ourselves. Aldermen, Paris has put her trust in
us; it is for us to justify that trust. The people are without jobs; it is for
us to create jobs for them; and if salt pork costs them a little more, we
shall at least have the consciousness of having sacrificed our personal
interests to those of the masses, as every right-thinking alderman should do.

<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>The Son:</b>
<td>Take heart, dear father; we shall find work somewhere else-in Poitou, in
Normandy, or in Brittany. It is said that all the industries of Paris are
gradually moving to these distant provinces.
<p>
<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>The Father:</b>
<td>That is quite understandable. Being unable any longer to sell us wood and
provisions, the people of these provinces have ceased to produce beyond their
own needs; whatever time and capital they have available they devote to making
for themselves what we once used to furnish them with.
<p>
<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>The Son:</b>
<td>Just as at Paris they have stopped making fine furniture and beautiful
clothing, and have turned to planting trees and raising pigs and cows.
Although still young, I have lived to see great stores, elegant neighborhoods,
and busy docks along the banks of the Seine overgrown with weeds and
underbrush.
<p>
<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>The Father:</b>
<td>While the hinterland is being covered with cities, Paris is becoming a
bare field. What an appalling reversal! And it took just three misguided
aldermen, helped by public ignorance, to bring this frightful calamity upon
US.

<b>The Son:</b>
<td>Tell me its history, Father.
<p>
<tr>
<td width="15%" valign=top>
<b>The Father:</b>
<td>It is really quite simple. Under the pretext of establishing three new
branches of industry in Paris and of thereby increasing job opportunities for
the working classes, these men had the importation of wood, butter, and meat
prohibited. They arrogated to themselves the right to provide their fellow
citizens with these commodities. First, their prices rose to exorbitant
heights. No one was earning enough to afford them, and the small number of
those who could obtain some, by spending all their earnings on them, were no
longer able to buy anything else. This at once spelled the doom of all the
industries in Paris, and the end came all the more quickly as the provinces no
longer provided our city with a market for its products. Poverty, death, and
emigration began to depopulate Paris.

side the people themselves, who see clearly the jobs that these three
protected industries give them, who know how many wood cutters and cowherds
they give employment to, but who cannot have as clear an idea of how much
employment would develop in the spacious atmosphere of free trade.

the aldermen will shut my mouth. Thus, the people will long continue in their
disastrously mistaken ways, and the political parties that place their trust
in arousing popular passions will concern themselves far less with dispelling
error than with exploiting the prevailing prejudices. Therefore, I shall have
on my hands at one and the same time the two most powerful forces of our

<td>And I, for my part, declare that if the poor cowherds and swineherds are
to be deprived of their daily bread, if they are to be sacrificed to theories,
I can no longer be answerable for public order. Workingmen, put no faith in
that man. He is an agent of perfidious Normandy; he goes there to get his
orders. He is a traitor; he must be hanged. <i>(The people remain silent.)</i>

<b>Jacques<br> Bonhomme:</b>
<td>Parisians, everything I am saying today, I was saying twenty years ago,
when Peter took it into his head to exploit the town tariff duties for his own
advantage and to your disadvantage. I am not, then, an agent of the Normans.
Hang me if you will, but that will not make oppression any the less
oppressive. Friends, it is neither Jacques Bonhomme nor Peter who must be
killed, but free trade if it frightens you, or restriction if it does you
harm.
