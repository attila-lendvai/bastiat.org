(date-tag[November 7th 1847.])
(p*[
Spain also has its association to defend ,(emph[Domestic Jobs]).
][
The goal it pursues it thus:
][
,(q[Considering ,(XXX :EO ["«" ouvrant manquant!])
a capital and the work that this capital can put in motion,
turn them away from jobs where they would yield a profit,
to direct them where they will yield a loss,
except, by some disguised tax,
to shift by legislative decree this loss on the public.])
][
In consequence, this club demands, amongst other things,
the exclusion of french products,
not of those that are costly
(laws are not needed to exclude them),
but of those that can be delivered cheaply.
What more, the cheaper we have them, the more Spain, they say,
is right in defending itself from them.
][
This inspires a reflection that I humbly submit to the reader.
][
One of the characters of Truth is Universality.
][
Should one recognize whether an association is founded on a good principle;
one only has to examine whether it sympathises with all the associations that,
under whichever latitude as they may be,
have adopted an identical principle.
][
Such are the associations promoting free trade.
One of our colleagues can go to Madrid, to Lisboa,
to London, to New-York, to Saint-Petersburg, to Berlin,
to Florence and to Rome, to Beijing even;
if there are in these towns associations promoting free trade,
they will certainly welcome him.
What he says here, he can say there,
confident that he will hurt neither opinions nor interests
as understood by these associations.
Between free-traders of all countries,
there is, in this matter, unity of faith.
][
Is it the same amongst protectionists?
Despite the community of ideas or rather of arguments,
did lord Bentinck, who just voted the exclusion of french cattle,
act according to the views of our livestock farmers?
Would the person who repelled in parliament our products from Rouen
be welcome in the Rouen comity?
Will those who will support next year the ,(cite-title[Act of Navigation])
and differential tariffs in India
stir enthousiasm amongst our shipowners?
Suppose that a member of the Odier comity be introduced
in the midst of the Spanish association to defend
,(emph[domestic jobs]),(pv)
what will he be able to say?
What words will be be able to pronounce without betraying
either the interests of his country or his own convictions?
Will he advise the Spaniards to open their harbors and their borders
to the products of our factories?
to not stand by the false doctrine
	of the ,(cite-title[balance of trade])? ,(XXX :EO 'in)
to not consider as advantageous
the industries that only survive through taxes levied on the community?
Will he tell them that preferential treatment in custom duties
do not create capital and jobs,
but only displace them, and in an unfortunate way?
Giving up his principles and his personal dignity thusly
might be applauded by his coreligionists from France
(for we remember that the Rouen comity, eigtheen months ago,
was very much discussed the opportunity of preaching free trade... in Spain),
but without fail he will be derided by his castilian listeners.
Placing his principles above his interests,
will he then want to display heroism?
Imagine this Brutus of restriction addressing the Spaniards in those terms:
,(q[You do well to raise the barriers that separate us.
I approve your repelling our boats,
our service providers, our salesmen,
our fabric of cotton, wool, thread and hemp,
our mules, our wallpapers, our machines, our furniture,
our fashion, our haberdashery, our silverware, our pottery,
our watches, our hardware, our perfumes,
our cabinets, our gloves, our books.
These are things that you must make yourself,
whatever work they demand,
and all the more so when they demand more work.
My only reproach to you
is that you only follow this principle half way.
It is too nice of you to pay us a ,(emph[tribute])
of ninety million francs and make yourself dependent upon us.
Do not trust your free-marketeers.
They are ideologistes, morons, traitors, etc.])
Such a nice discours might be applauded in Catalonia,
but would it be approved in Lille and in Rouen?
][
It is therefore established that
protectionist associations of various countries
are opposed to each other,
despite their using the same label,
and their professing the same apparent doctrines;
what is most peculiar, should they sympathize with something,
from a country to the other, it is with free trade associations.
][
The reason is simple.
Indeed they want two contradictory things:
,(emph[restrictions, and opportunities]).
To give and not to receive,
to sell and not to buy,
to export and not to import,
there is the crux of their weird doctrine.
It leads them very logically to hold two stances,
not just different from each other but opposed to each other,
one for domestic matters, the other for foreign countries,
with the remarquable circumstance that,
should their advice be admitted on both sides,
they wouldn't be one inch nearer to their goal.
][
In fact, when considering the transactions between two people,
what is export for one is import for the other.
Look at this beautiful ship that cruises the sea
and carries inside a valuable cargo.
Please tell me how to name these goods.
Are they ,(emph[imports]) or ,(emph[exports])?
Isn't it clear that they are both at the same time,
depending on whether you have the sender or the recipient in mind?
Therefore if no one wants to be recipient, no one will be sender;
and it is unavoidable that, all in all,
,(emph[opportunities]) diminish just as much
as ,(emph[restrictions]) tighten.
Thus, one reaches this bizarre policy:
here, to encourage the cargo to go out,
we endow it with a ,(emph[subsidy]) at the expense of the public;
there, to impede its entry,
it is taxed with a ,(emph[tariff]) at the expense of the public;
can any more absurd a fight be conceived?
And who will be the victor?
The people that is ready to pay the highest subsidy or the highest tariff.
][
No, the truth cannot be found in this heap of contradictions et antagonisms.
The whole system rests on this idea that
,(emph[trade]) is a fraud for the party who receives;
and, beside the fact that the very word ,(emph[trade]) belies this idea,
since it implies that both sides receive,
what man cannot feel the ridiculous position where he places himself
when he can only tell the foreigner:
,(emph[I advise you to be a fool]),
especially as he is fooled himself by his own advice?
][
Therewith here is a small sample of protectionist propaganda abroad:
])
(subtitle[The Bridge over the Bidassoa River])
(p*[
A man left Paris, rue Hauteville,
with the pretension to teach Political Economics to the nations.
He arrived at the Bidassoa river.
The bridge was very crowded and such a large public could but tempt our professor.
He leaned against the guardrail, turning his back to the Ocean;
and, taking care, to prove his disregard of national prejudices,
of putting his vertable spine in perfect coincidence
with the ideal line that splits France from Spain,
he started thusly:
]
(q[All of you who listen to me,
desire to know which trade is good and which trade is bad.
At first it seems that I shouldn't have anything to teach you in this respect;
for indeed, each of you knows his own interests,
at least as well as I know them myself;
but interest is a misleading signal,
and I am a member of an association
that despises this vulgar motive.
I am bringing you another infallible rule
of which the application is easiest.
Before to start a transaction with some man, make him talk.
If, after you speak to him in French, he replies in Spanish,
or ,(inlatin[the other way around]),
then stop right there, the proof is found, the trade is of an evil nature.])
[A voice. ,(--) We speak neither Spanish nor French;
we all speak the same language, ,(emph[escualdun]),
that you call basque.]
[
,(--) Darn! says the speaker to himself,
I didn't expect the objection.
I have to change my position.
,(--) Well then! My friends, here is another rule, just as easy:
those of you who are born on this side of the line (showing Spain)
can trade, without hurdle, with all the country that
that extends to my right to columns of Hercules and not beyond;
and those who are born on that side (showing France)
can trade at their leisure in the whole region that unfolds to my left,
until that other ideal line running between White-Misseron and Quiévrain...
and not further.
Trade made this way will enrich you.
As for trade made over the Bidassoa river,
it would ruin you before you can realize it.]
[
Another voice. ,(--)
If trade made over the Nivelle river,
two miles away from here, are good,
how can trade made over the Bidassoa river be bad?
Do the waters of the Bidassoa river release a peculiar gas
that poisons trade that crosses it?
][
,(--) You are too curious, replied the professor;
proud Basque, my friend, you must believe my word. ,(XXX :q)
][
However our man, having thought about the doctrine he just expounded,
thought to himself:
,(q[I only defended half the interests of my country.])
Having demanded silence, he continued his discourse as follows:
]
(q[Do not believe that I am a man ,(emph[of principles])
and that what I just told you should be a ,(emph[system]).
The heaven save me from that!
My commercial arrangement is so little ,(emph[theoretical]),
so natural, so fitting your inclination,
however unaware you may be of it,
that it will easily be impressed upon you at gunpoint.
The utopians are those who dare claim that
a transaction is good whenever those who trade consider it such:
what a terrifying newfangled doctrine, imported from England,
and to which people would naturally let themselves go
if armed forces didn't put things right.
])
(q[But, to prove you that I am neither exclusive nor absolute,
I will tell you that my thought isn't to condemn all transactions
that you could be tempted to make
from one bank of the Bidassoa river to the other bank.
I admit that your carts may freely cross the bridge,
as long as they arrive ,(strong[full]) from this side
(showing France), et ,(strong[empty]) from that side (showing Spain).
By this clever arrangement, you will all gain:
You, the Spaniards, because you will receive without giving,
and you, the French, because you give without receiving.
Above all do not think of this as a system.])
[
But the Basques are hardheaded.
However you may repeat to them:
this isn't a system, a theory, a utopia, a principle;
these oratory precautions do not have the power
	to make them understand that which is ununderstandable.
Accordingly, despite the wise advise of the professor,
whenever they are allowed (and sometimes even when they are not),
they trade according to the old-fashioned method (that is said to be new-fangled),
that is, the way that their fathers traded,
and when they cannot do it over the Bidassoa river,
they do it under the river, so blind that they are!
